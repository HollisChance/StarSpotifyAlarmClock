Just download the software from [here](https://sourceforge.net/projects/starspotifyalarmclock/files/latest/download) unzip it into the folder of your choise and run "StarSpotifyAlarmClock.exe" to se witch attributes you need to send to the application.
I also recomend you to create a Windows scheduled task that runs the software at your desired wakeup time and with the arguments needed.
